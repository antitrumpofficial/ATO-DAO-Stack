# 🔍 ATO DAO Stack – Audit Hints & Security Notes

## 🛡️ General Security Architecture

- All contracts are implemented using OpenZeppelin’s **UUPSUpgradeable** pattern.
- Roles and access are enforced via `AccessControlUpgradeable`.
- Every critical function is permissioned with appropriate roles: `DAO_ROLE`, `GUARDIAN_ROLE`, or `COUNCIL_ROLE`.

---

## 🧠 Upgradeability (UUPS Pattern)

- Each contract uses a `constructor()` that disables initializers.
- Upgrade is only possible via `_authorizeUpgrade()` by `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE`.
- All upgrade operations should be governed via DAO or a multisig.

---

## 🔐 Role Governance Model

- Full role hierarchy is documented in `roles.md`.
- After deployment, it is strongly advised to transfer `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE` to the DAO-controlled multisig.
- No public or unauthenticated administrative functions exist.

## 💡 Module-Specific Audit Hints

| Module            | Key Considerations |
|-------------------|--------------------|
| **ATOStaking**    | Ensure reward calculation based on real-time duration. Verify no overflow or underflow in `claim()` and `emergencyUnstake()`. |
| **ATOReferral**   | Abuse prevention via `IAIReferralMonitor`. Duplicate or circular referrals are restricted. |
| **ATOCivicNFT**   | NFTs store category and timestamp in on-chain metadata. Metadata integrity is maintained. |
| **ATONGOFund**    | Only registered NGOs can submit requests. DAO must explicitly approve each fund request. |
| **ATOTreasury**   | Multi-approval + AI Guardian control on all transfers. Circuit Breaker halts execution under threat. |
| **ATOArbitrationCouncil** | Disputes are hashed and immutable. Council members resolve based on predefined roles. |

---

## 📌 External Interfaces (Dependency Injection)

- All AI modules are injected via `setX()` functions with `DAO_ROLE`.
  - `IAIReferralMonitor`
  - `IAIGuardian`
  - `IAIRiskEngine`
  - `IAIDisputeResolver`
- Events are emitted when any dependency is updated.

---

## ⚠️ Potential Edge Cases to Test

- `ATOTreasury.transfer()`: Ensure token balance is checked before transfer.
- `ATOReferral.processReward()`: Ensure sufficient token balance before reward issuance.
- `ATOStaking.emergencyUnstake()`: Validate duration logic and 3% penalty enforcement.
- `Civic NFT`: Burn function should verify ownership before deletion.

---

## ✅ Suggested Testing Strategy

- Role misassignment & access violation tests
- Upgrade flow and initializer tests
- Inter-contract interaction tests (e.g. proposal → transfer)
- ABI and frontend compatibility (Snapshot, Dashboard, etc.)
- Time-based testing for `claim()` and staking rewards

---

## 🔁 Test Tools Recommended

- **Foundry / Hardhat / Truffle**
- **Remix for initial deployments**
- **Snapshot (off-chain governance simulation)**

---

## 📦 Audit Deliverables Suggested

- Coverage reports per module
- Static analysis (Slither, MythX)
- Manual review of UUPS `delegatecall` patterns
- Linting: solidity v0.8.30, optimization enabled, 200 runs
